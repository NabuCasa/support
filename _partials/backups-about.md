## About backups

It is important to regularly back up your Home Assistant setup.
You may have spent many hours configuring your system and creating automations. Keep your configurations safe so that you can restore your setup from a backup in case of need.

A backup includes your system configuration, add-on data, automations, scripts, and media stored on Home Assistant.
