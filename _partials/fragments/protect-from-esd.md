1. Protecting from ESD.

   - Grounding protects the components from the static electricity that can be naturally present (electrostatic discharge, ESD).

      > **Notice**: **Risk of damage to the equipment due to electrostatic discharge.**
      >
      > - Always: Touch the working surface before touching electronics.
      > - Ideally: Use ESD protective equipment, such as ESD table mats and grounding cords.
