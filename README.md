# Zendesk support integration
This is a work in progress and is private until a workflow is designed

This repo is made to sync source content to Zendesk using their API. It will provide documentation and support articles instead of using the Zendesk editor.

The ideal goals for this repo are as follows:

- To keep all support documentation open source
- To standardise the way support documentation is written
- To maintain the theme within Zendesk
