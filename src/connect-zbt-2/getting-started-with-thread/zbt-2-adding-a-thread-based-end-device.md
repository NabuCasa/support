1. Before you can add a Thread-based device to Home Assistant, make sure you have added your {{ productName }} to Home Assistant first.
   - [Forming a new Thread network with {{ productName }}](/hc/en-us/articles/31347105826077)
   - [Migrating from one Thread adapter to another Thread adapter](/hc/en-us/articles/32087461954589)
   - [Switching from Zigbee to Thread support on {{ productName }}](/hc/en-us/articles/31347057208989)
   - Of course you can also use another Thread adapter, but this is the {{ productName }} documentation.
2. To add your Thread-based devices to Home Assistant, follow the steps in the [Home Assistant Thread documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/thread/#adding-a-thread-based-device-to-home-assistant)
