## Restoring from a backup during onboarding

1. If you want to migrate your configuration from another device, make sure the [prerequisites](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup-during-onboarding) are met. Specifically, check the size of your current installation. Home Assistant Green has 32 GB of disk space, so your installation needs to be a bit smaller than that.
2. Start up Home Assistant Green as described in the [getting started](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) procedure.
3. Follow the steps described in the [restoring a backup during onboarding](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup-during-onboarding) procedure.

## Restoring a backup on your current installation

If you want to restore your full configuration or even only parts of it, follow the steps described in the procedure on [restoring a backup on your current system](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#to-restore-a-backup-on-your-current-system).
