## Prerequisites

{% steps %}
{% prereq %}
{% image "/static/img/green/green_without_sd_card.png" "Image showing a Home Assistant Green without an SD card" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Home Assistant Green
- microSD card
- Memory card reader for microSD (your computer might have an integrated card reader, otherwise use an external one)
- Computer with internet access
- You have [created a backup](/hc/en-us/articles/25154828325917) and stored it on another system

{% endprereq %}
{% endsteps %}

{% hazard "notice" %}

**Risk of losing your configuration**

This process clears the data disk on your Green. Unless you [create a backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#backups), you will lose all data and configuration settings.

- A device reset wipes the data partition of your device. It removes all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and any installed add-ons. The Home Assistant Operating System stays on the system.
- Once a device wipe is initiated, the data partition is marked as to be cleared on boot. Then, the system reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.
- To avoid losing data and configuration settings, [create a backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#backups) and [define a backup location](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-backup-locations) outside of your Home Assistant.
