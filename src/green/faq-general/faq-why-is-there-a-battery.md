  name: Why is there an optional CR2032 battery on Home Assistant Green? Do I need to add one?

The battery serves as a backup power supply for the real-time clock.

You need to install a battery only if you are planning to boot the Home Assistant Green in an environment where there is no internet connection for an extended period of time. Then the clock cannot synchronize.

When installing the CR2032 battery, make sure the positive side is facing upwards. You should see the plus sign on top.
