Follow these steps if you want to shut down the system.

## To shut down the system

1. **Option 1**: Shutting down the system from the UI.
   - In your Home Assistant UI, go to [**Settings** > **System**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_dashboard/).
   - In the top-right corner, select the three-dots menu. Select **Restart Home Assistant**.
   - Then, select **Shut down system**
   - Wait until all the LEDs turned off.

2. **Option 2**: Shutting down the system using the hardware button
   - Use this option in case the shutdown via UI doesn't work:
   - To shutdown gracefully, press the power button for 6 seconds.
   - For a hard shutdown (do this only if all else fails), press the power button for 12 seconds.
   - Wait until all the LEDs turned off.
