## Symptom

You followed the steps on [resetting the device without SD card (OS version 13.1 and later)](/hc/en-us/articles/25161225495837), but the reset failed.

## Resolution

1. Check which version of Home Assistant Operating System you have installed on Home Assistant Green.
   - Go to [**Settings** > **About**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/info/).

2. If you have Home Assistant Operating System version 13.1 and later:

   - The cause might be that you did not wait long enough after shutting down the device. Repeat the steps on [resetting the device without SD card](/hc/en-us/articles/25161225495837) and after shut down, make sure to wait until all the LEDs turned off.
3. If you have OS version older than 13.1: Follow the steps on [resetting the device using an SD card (OS version 13.1 and older)](/hc/en-us/articles/25162566451485).
