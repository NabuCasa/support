1. In the Home Assistant command line, you can now enter a [command](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#home-assistant-via-the-command-line).
   - For example, if you are locked out, you can change your password:

      ```shell
      auth reset --username 'existing_user' --password 'new_password'
      ```

2. Log in with the new password.
3. Go to your [User profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile/) and on the **Security** tab, replace the simple password with a complex one.
