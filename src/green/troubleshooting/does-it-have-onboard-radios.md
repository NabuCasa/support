- No. Home Assistant Green does not have any onboard radios.
- For Zigbee or Thread, you can use a [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1](https://www.home-assistant.io/connectzbt1).
- For Bluetooth, you can use [an ESPHome as a Bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth) or add a USB dongle and use [local Bluetooth support](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/).
