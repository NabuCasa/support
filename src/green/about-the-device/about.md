## Smart home hub for Home Assistant

Home Assistant Green is a smart home hub designed to run Home Assistant. It comes with a preinstalled Home Assistant Operating System. Because smart home hubs usually run around the clock, Green has a low power consumption: under heavy load, it uses ~3&nbsp;W, 1.7&nbsp;W when idle.

No custom hardware components required. Connect power and Ethernet and you are ready to get started with Home Assistant.
