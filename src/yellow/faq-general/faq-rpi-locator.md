Recommended hardware:

- Min. 4 GB of RAM.
- Min. 32 GB of eMMC flash space.
- If you opt for the CM4 or CM5 Lite: as the Lite variant does not have an eMMC module, you must use an NVMe SSD hard drive.
  - Some users reported that [these SSDs](/hc/en-us/articles/25592268332445) are not working on the Home Assistant Yellow.
