No, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 Active Cooler is not supported on Home Assistant Yellow. There is no fan plug providing the required 5&nbsp;V and PWM signals.

If you are installing the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 on Yellow, you can keep using the heat sink that is shipped with Home Assistant Yellow.
