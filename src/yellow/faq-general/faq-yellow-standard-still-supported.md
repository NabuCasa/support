The Home Assistant Yellow Standard was originally designed to be the beginner option in our product line, as it was pre-assembled and easier to get started with.

In 2023, we launched the [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green), which offered similar features, including easy setup, but at a lower price point. This led us to end the manufacture of the Home Assistant Yellow Standard and focus on Yellow Kit versions for advanced users.

Rest assured, as the Home Assistant Yellow Standard hardware is identical to our Kits, it will continue to receive the same support and software updates.
