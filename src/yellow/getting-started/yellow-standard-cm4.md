{% image "/static/img/yellow/yellow-standard-unboxed.jpeg" "Home Assistant Yellow with power supply" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Plug in your Ethernet cable and make sure it is locked into place.
- The other end of the Ethernet cable will need to be connected to your router or switch and connected to the internet.
- **Note**: Internet is required because the newly installed Home Assistant OS does not contain all Home Assistant components yet. It downloads the latest version of Home Assistant Core on first start.

{% step "Power it up" %}
