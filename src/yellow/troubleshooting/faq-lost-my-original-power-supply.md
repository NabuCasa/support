The Home Assistant Yellow uses a 12&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC, 2&nbsp;A, center-positive power supply. 5.5 mm * 2.1 mm DC barrel connector.

- If you ordered a Home Assistant Yellow with PoE (Power over Ethernet), no additional power supply is needed if you are using PoE (48&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC, 0.6&nbsp;A).

- If you're unsure which version you have, check the bottom of your device. There is a label indicating the input power, and whether it is a PoE model or not.
