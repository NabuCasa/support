The Home Assistant Yellow uses a 12&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC, 2&nbsp;A, center-positive power supply.

If you ordered a The Home Assistant Yellow with PoE (Power over Ethernet), no additional power supply is needed if you are using PoE (48&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC, 0.6&nbsp;A).

If you're unsure which version you have, check the bottom of your device. There is a label indicating the input power, and whether it is a PoE model or not.
