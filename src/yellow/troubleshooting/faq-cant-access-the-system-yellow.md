1. If [http://homeassistant.local:8123](http://homeassistant.local:8123) doesn't work, try [http://homeassistant:8123](http://homeassistant:8123). If that does not help, you may be able to find the IP address of Home Assistant Yellow on your router. The URL will be `http://<IP ADDRESS>:8123`.

2. Check if the Home Assistant Yellow is plugged in and the yellow LED blinks in a heartbeat pattern. For more information on the LED patterns, see [Home Assistant Yellow LEDs](/hc/en-us/articles/25410366475165-About-the-LEDs).
