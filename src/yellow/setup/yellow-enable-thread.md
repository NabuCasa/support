Step-by-step instructions on configuring the Home Assistant Yellow for Thread support. This setup facilitates the connection of Matter-over-Thread devices to your network.

> This guide installs a firmware which supports only Thread! If you use your Yellow to control Zigbee devices, you will no longer be able to control them after installing the Thread firmware. If you want to use both Thread and Zigbee with your Home Assistant Yellow, you will need an additional radio, such as [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1](https://www.home-assistant.io/connectzbt1).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the following setup:

- Home Assistant Yellow up and running.
- Home Assistant OS installation.
- Multiprotocol support disabled: Refer to the [Disable multiprotocol support](/hc/en-us/articles/25744235797661-Disabling-multiprotocol-support) procedure.

## Enabling dedicated Thread support

1. Delete the Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) integration.

   - If you have a new Yellow or did not setup Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) yet, skip to Step 2.
   - If you are using the Yellow with Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA), this step removes Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) from the integration list.
     1. Go to [**Settings** > **Devices & services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).
     2. Select the **Zigbee Home Automation integration** card.
     3. Select the menu behind the **Yellow** integration and choose **Delete**.
     4. In the pop-up menu, select **Delete again** to confirm deletion.
