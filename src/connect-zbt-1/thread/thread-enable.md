This guide outlines the steps for configuring the Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 for dedicated Thread support. This setup facilitates the connection of Matter-over-Thread devices to your network.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the following setup:

{% steps %}
{% prereq %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/connect-zbt-1-zha-setup.png" "Screenshot showing the Zigbee integration page" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Connected Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1.
- [Home Assistant Operating System](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-operating-system) installation.
- You don't have Multiprotocol enabled. If you do, disable it by following the steps in the procedure on [disabling multiprotocol support](/hc/en-us/articles/26124969612445).
- **Important:** This guide installs firmware that supports only Thread! If you use your Connect ZBT-1 to control Zigbee devices, you will no longer be able to control them after installing the Thread firmware.

## To enable dedicated Thread support

{% steps %}
{% step "Choosing your scenario" %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/connect-zbt-1-zha-delete.png" "Migrate your Zigbee network or delete the ZHA integration" %}
{% stepContent %}

- **Scenario 1**: If you have a new Connect ZBT-1 or did not set up Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) yet, skip to Step 2.
- **Scenario 2**: If you use your existing Connect ZBT-1 to run a Zigbee network, [Migrate your Zigbee network](/hc/en-us/articles/26123655295261) to another controller.
  - Otherwise, if you delete the Zigbee network, even if you set it up again, all of your entity customizations will be gone.
- **Scenario 3**: If you are using the Connect ZBT-1 with Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA), and you no longer need a Zigbee network, follow these steps to remove ZHA from the integration list:

  1. Go to [**Settings** > **Devices & services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).
  2. Select the **Zigbee Home Automation** integration card.
  3. Select the menu behind the **Connect ZBT-1 v1.0** integration and choose **Delete**.
  4. On the pop-up menu, select **Delete** again to confirm deletion.
