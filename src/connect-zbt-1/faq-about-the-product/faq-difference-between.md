Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 is the new name for Home Assistant SkyConnect.

Though it's a new name and look, they have the exact same hardware, capability, and support.

We made this change to help make room for a new line of Connect products, specifically an upcoming Z-Wave Connect product. Going forward, whenever we mention updates or features for Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, this will also apply to SkyConnect-branded devices. Retailers will continue to sell SkyConnect-branded devices while supplies last, and we would encourage you to purchase whatever is available as they are functionally identical.
