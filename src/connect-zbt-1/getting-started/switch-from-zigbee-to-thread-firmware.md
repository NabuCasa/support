## Prerequisites

{% prereq %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/zbt-thread-preferred-network.png" "Screenshot showing the Thread network page" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Connected {{ productName }}.
- [Home Assistant Operating System](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-operating-system) installation.
- You are currently using {{ productName }} as a Thread adapter, but want to use it as a Zigbee adapter from now on.

- **Important:** By following this guide, you will install firmware that supports only Zigbee! You will no longer be able to control your Thread devices with this adapter after installing the Zigbee firmware. Depending on whether you want to keep your Thread network (on an other device) or not, follow the steps in one of the following scenarios:
  - **Scenario 1: You want to keep the Thread network**: If you use your existing {{ productName }} as a border router to run a Thread network, add another border router. Otherwise, you will lose your Thread network.
  - **Scenario 2: You no longer need the Thread network**: If you use your existing {{ productName }} as a border router to run a Thread network, and you no longer need a Thread network, follow these steps to uninstall the **OpenThread Border Router** add-on:

    1. Go to **Settings** > **Add-ons**.
    2. Select the **OpenThread Border Router** add-on and choose **Uninstall**.
