## Symptom

My Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 device is completely unresponsive.

## Resolution

1. Plug your device into a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine.
2. If there is no acknowledgment that even an unknown device was inserted, then check the device for a small deformation under the Home Assistant logo.
   - If it has this deformation, this is symptomatic of a defective ZBT-1, which may require replacement.
   - To learn more, read our FAQ on the [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 replacement program](/hc/en-us/articles/26126238453149/).
   - SkyConnect branded devices are unaffected by this issue and do not require replacement.
