Before you can use Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, you need to connect it to a smart home hub running Home Assistant. The following steps show you how to do this.

There are 2 main installation scenarios.

1. **Scenario 1**: [Connect ZWA-2 to Home Assistant and create a new Z-Wave network](#im-new-to-z-wave-connect-zwa-2-to-home-assistant)
   - Follow these steps if you do not have a Z-Wave network yet.
2. **Scenario 2**: [Migrate your existing Z-Wave network to Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2](#migrate-your-existing-z-wave-network-to-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2)
   - Follow these steps if you already have a Z-Wave network running with another controller and you want to migrate to Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2.

The **Prerequisites** are the same for both scenarios.

## Scenario 1: Connect ZWA-2 to Home Assistant and create a new Z-Wave network

1. If you run Home Assistant but donâ€™t have a Z-Wave network yet, follow [these steps to connect Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 to Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/#setting-up-a-z-wave-js-server).

2. If you are running another hub (not Home Assistant), and if you are outside the EU, you might need to [override the radio frequency and transmit power levels in the Z-Wave JS add-on](/hc/en-us/articles/29059418289821) during setup.

## Scenario 2: Migrate your existing Z-Wave network to Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2

{% callout "important" %}

If you want to migrate from a **Nortek HUSBZB-1**: there is no (easy) way to update that device.

- You need to set up a new network.

  - If you are comfortable with soldering and have time and patience: some users have reported that they were able to upgrade the firmware of the Nortek HUSBZB-1 with [this procedure](https://community.hubitat.com/t/guide-nortek-husbzb-1-nvm-backup-restore-and-updating-z-wave-firmware/48012).

{% endcallout %}

- If you already have a Z-Wave network, follow the [steps in the Z-Wave integration documentation on migrating your Z-Wave network to Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/#migrating-a-z-wave-network-to-a-new-adapter).

- If you want to run Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 with another hub (not Home Assistant) and if you are outside the EU, you might need to [override the radio frequency and transmit power in the Z-Wave JS add-on](/hc/en-us/articles/29059418289821).

- If you are using the **Z-Wave JS UI** add-on (and not the default **Z-Wave JS** add-on), follow these steps:
  - Before starting migration, disable the Z-Wave JS integration:
    - Go to [**Settings** > **Devices & services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/) and select the **Z-Wave** integration.
    - Select the three-dot menu and select **Disable**.
    - Do the migration in **Z-Wave JS UI**.
      - Open the **Z-Wave JS UI** control panel and in the bottom-right corner, select the purple **Advanced actions** button.
      - Under **NVM Management**, select **Backup**.
      - Unplug the adapter and connect Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2.
      - Under **Settings** > **UI** > **Z-Wave**, enter the region and save.
      - In the control panel, select the purple **Advanced actions** button and under **NVM Management**, select **Restore**.
  - Enable the Z-Wave integration again.
