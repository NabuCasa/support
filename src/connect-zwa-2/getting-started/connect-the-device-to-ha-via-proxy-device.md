If you need to place Connect ZWA-2 far away from your Home Assistant system, you can run Z-Wave JS on another system and connect that to Home Assistant.

This allows you to plug Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 in a location that is closer to your end devices.

## Prerequisites

- A system that can act as proxy and fulfills the following requirements:
  - has an Ethernet connection (Wi-Fi will be less reliable) to your network.
  - can run containers (for instance, a Raspberry Pi system with Docker installed).
  - Is located in a place where there is space to place Connect ZWA-2 in a vertical position.
- A Home Assistant smart home hub, for example, a Home Assistant Green.
  - If you do not have Home Assistant installed on the hub yet, [follow these steps](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/).
- Home Assistant 2025.8 or newer installed on your smart home hub.
- Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 with a USB-C to USB-A cable (included in the box).
