Before installing and using Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, find a good spot for it.

1. Place the device away from objects that may cause interference or block signals, such as:
   - thick walls
   - wire mesh
   - metal (such as server rack housings or wall mounting brackets)
   - other transmitters (such as computers, routers, USB 3.0 ports)
   - an aquarium.
2. To check if your device is in a good spot or if there is interference, follow the steps under [checking the distance to other transmitters to avoid interference](/hc/en-us/articles/28670741134365)
