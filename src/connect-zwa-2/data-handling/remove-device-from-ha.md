The steps to remove Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 from Home Assistant are the same as for any Z-Wave adapter.

There are 2 ways to do this:

- **Option 1**: [remove Z-Wave completely from Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/#removing-z-wave-js-from-home-assistant).
  - Do this if you no longer use Z-Wave devices.
- **Option 2**: [migrate your network from Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 to another adapter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js/#migrating-a-z-wave-network-to-a-new-adapter).
  - Do this if you want to keep using your Z-Wave network with another adapter.
