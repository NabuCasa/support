You can use scripts and automations to control the device. The steps below show a few examples of what you could do.

## Example 1: Playing announcements on the device

You can create an automation or script to play an announcement on the device.

1. Go to [**Settings** > **Automations & scripts**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/) and create a new automation.
2. Define your trigger.
3. Under **Then do**, select **Add action** and from the menu, select **Assist satellite**.
4. Select **Announce**.
5. Enter the message you want to play and select the device you want to play it on.
6. Save the automation.

If you prefer editing in YAML, you can find an example with the [`assist_satellite.announce`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/assist_satellite/#action-assist_satelliteannounce) action below.

    ```yaml
    action: assist_satellite.announce
      data:
        message: The laundry is done
      target:
        entity_id: assist_satellite.home_assistant_voice_012345
    ```

## Example 2: Controlling the color of the LED ring

You can use [`light.turn_on`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light/#action-lightturn_on) and [`light.turn_off`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light/#action-lightturn_off) actions to control the light.

You can turn it on or off when something happens and define color and effects.

```yaml
action: light.turn_on
  data:
    rgb_color:
      - 255
      - 105
      - 180
  target:
    entity_id: light.home_assistant_voice_012345_led_ring
action: light.turn_off
target:
  entity_id: light.home_assistant_voice_012345_led_ring
```

## Example 3: Changing the selected assistant

1.  To select a different assistant when something happens, use the [`select.select_option`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/select/#action-selectselect_option) action. For example, when a button is pressed.

        ```yaml
        action: select.select_option
          data:
            option: preferred
          target:
            entity_id: select.home_assistant_voice_012345_assist_pipeline
        ```

2.  Under **Options**, enter the name of the voice assistant.
    - Make sure to spell it exactly as you named it. For example `Spanish`.
3.  To learn how to set up an automation based on a button press, follow the steps on [Automating on a button press](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/event/#automating-on-a-button-press).

    - **Info**: Those instructions are based on a Matter device. The process is very similar for other devices featuring a button.

## Example 4: Changing the wake word

1.  To select a different wake word when something happens, use the [`select.select_option`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/select/#action-selectselect_option) action.

          ```yaml
          action: select.select_option
            data:
              option: Okay Nabu
            target:
              entity_id: select.home_assistant_voice_012345_wake_word
          ```

2.  Under **Options**, enter the preferred wake word. The default options are `Hey Jarvis`, `Hey Mycroft`, and `Okay Nabu`.

    - Make sure to spell it exactly as you named it.
