## Symptom

My voice assistant understands me and processes the command, but I donâ€™t get a voice response.

## Description

The voice response is generated in Home Assistant by one of our supported text-to-speech (or TTS) engines. The voice assistant device then fetches the audio file from Home Assistant and plays it back. This fetching process only works if Home Assistant can communicate its own URL to the device. If you have a complex network setup, or if you changed this setting in the past, the URL communicated could be wrong.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- You need administrator rights on Home Assistant

### To troubleshoot the connection to the voice assistant device

1. Make sure the voice assistant device can reach Home Assistant via the local Home Assistant URL (from inside your network, not using the external URL you use to access Home Assistant from outside your network).
   1. Go to your [user profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile/) and enable **Advanced mode**.
   2. Go to [**Settings** > **System** > **Network**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/network/).
   3. Change your **Local network** Home Assistant URL to a URL that can be reached locally and that points to Home Assistant.
   4. For most users, the **Automatic** option works and is recommended.

2. Another reason the connection fails could be an invalid SSL certificate.
   - The voice assistant device rejects invalid SSL certificates.
   - If the certificate is expired, your browser will tell you.
   - Create a new SSL certificate.
