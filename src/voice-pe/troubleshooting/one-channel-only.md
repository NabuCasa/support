## Symptom

You connected an external speaker via the 3.5 mm (⅛”) stereo audio connector. You can hear sound, but only on one channel.

## Cause

There is a gap between the audio connector component on the PCB and the enclosure. Depending on the plug you're using, it might not go all the way in.

## Resolution

Try a different cable.
