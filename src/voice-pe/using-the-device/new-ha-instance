When connecting your Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition (VPE) device to a new Home Assistant instance, a factory reset is required. This is because the VPE device stores an encryption key tied to the original Home Assistant instance, even if the device is removed from that setup.
A factory reset removes this key and allows the device to securely pair with a new instance. This may be necessary if youâ€™ve reinstalled Home Assistant from scratch, are setting up a new environment, or want to use the device with a different system.

## To reset the device

{% steps %}
{% step "Removing the device from Home Assistant (if accessible)" %}
{% image "/static/img/voice-pe/voice_delete_integration_instance.png" "Screenshot showing where to remove the integration" %}
{% stepContent %}

- If you still have access to the Home Assistant instance the device was previously connected to, follow the [removing an integration instance](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#removing-an-integration-instance).

*This step is optional but recommended before resetting the device.*

{% endstepContent %}
{% endstep %}

{% step "Press the button until it lights up red (22 seconds)" %}
{% image "/static/img/voice-pe/voice_reset_v2_480.webp" "Clip showing how to start the reset process by pressing the central button" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Keep pressing the button until the red circle is complete and the device tells you to stop pressing.

  - {% stepResult "All data (including encryption key) is cleared from the device." %}

  - **Info**: If you stop pressing the button before the red light has completed the circle, the reset process is aborted.

  - **Info**: Once the reset is complete, the device starts up again. The white twinkle indicates that it is ready to be paired with a new Home Assistant instance.
