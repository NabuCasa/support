## Prerequisites

- External speaker with 3.5 mm stereo headphone connector

## To connect an external speaker

1. Connect your external speaker to the headphone jack on Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition.
2. Play media or talk to Voice.
   - **Troubleshooting**:
     - If you only hear one channel on your external speaker, the cable might not go all the way in due to a gap between the housing and the connector.
       - Try a different cable.
