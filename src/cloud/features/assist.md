Currently, over 50 languages are supported. To check if yours is there, go to [**Settings** > **Voice Assistant**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/voice_assistants/) and select **Home Assistant Cloud**. Open the **Language** dropdown. Select your language and check if it appears as a **Conversation agent**. If it's there, your language is supported.

## Make an announcement

You can [use Assist in automations](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/using_tts_in_automation/) to make an announcement. For example, it could tell you that your coffee is ready. Or use the upstairs speaker to tell your kids that dinner is ready.

## Use your voice to trigger an automation

You can even [define your own commands](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/custom_sentences/) to start your automation.

## Use OpenAI with Assist

You can give your voice assistant personality [by using OpenAI](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/#give-your-voice-assistant-personality-using-the-openai-integration).

We used a classic landline phone to talk to Mario, just for fun. But you can do this with any supported device. You could use your mobile phone, for example.
