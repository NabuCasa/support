## Symptom

Under [**System** > **Home Assistant Cloud**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/), **Remote connection**, you see the following message:

**Remote access is being prepared. We will notify you when it's ready**.

<img src="/static/img/cloud/cannot-retrieve-certificate-01.png" alt="Remote access is being prepared">

## Description

This message indicates that there is an issue generating the SSL certificate that is used to create an encrypted connection between your Home Assistant instance and Nabu&nbsp;Casa&nbsp;Cloud.

## Resolution

Depending on what is causing this issue, there are different steps you can try to resolve this.

1. Wait for 5 minutes. It may take a while to generate the certificate.
2. Check if there is a general network issue.

If none of the above applies, check if there is an IPv6 issue.

1. To check the IPv6 connection, in your browser, open [test-ipv6.com](https://test-ipv6.com/).

   - Try the steps suggested by the website.

2. If the IPv6 test revealed that there is an IPv6 issue, and if you are not running Home Assistant on a VM, try disabling IPv6:
   - In the UI, go to [**System** > **Network**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/network/).
   - Under **Configure network interfaces**, expand the **IPv6** dropdown.
   - Choose the **disabled** option and save the changes.
   - To have all network settings applied from scratch, reboot the host. Select **Settings** > **System** > **Restart Home Assistant** (top right) > Expand Advanced Options > **Reboot system**.

If the problem persists, try resetting your Home Assistant Cloud data and requesting a new certificate:

1. Open [**Settings** > **Home Assistant Cloud**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/).
2. Select the **three dots menu** (â‹®) in the upper-right corner.
3. Select **Reset cloud data**.
4. Restart Home Assistant:
   - Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Restart Home Assistant** (top right).
   - Select **Reboot system**.
5. Once Home Assistant restarts, go back to the **Home Assistant Cloud** page and sign in with your Nabu Casa credentials.
6. Wait a few minutes while Home Assistant attempts to request and download a new SSL certificate for your remote URL.

If resetting cloud data **did not resolve the issue**, **do not reset it again**. Instead, enable debug logging to help diagnose the problem:

1. Add the following logger configuration to your [`configuration.yaml`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) file:

   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       homeassistant.components.cloud: debug
       hass_nabucasa: debug
       acme: debug
       snitun: debug
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant and allow it to run for approximately 15 minutes.
3. Download the Home Assistant Core logs from [**Settings** > **System** > **Logs**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/logs/).
4. Use the 'Submit a ticket' button on this page and include the downloaded logs with your request. The debug information will help identify the root cause of your issue.
