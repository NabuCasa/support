If you want to delete your Nabu Casa account, you need to cancel your subscription first.

## To cancel the subscription and delete the account

1. Cancelling your Home Assistant Cloud subscription.
   - If you are currently subscribed to Home Assistant Cloud, you need to cancel your subscription before deleting your account.
   - Log in to your [Nabu Casa account](https://account.nabucasa.com/), and under **Manage plan**, select **Cancel plan**.
   - **Result**: the page shows the date when the Home Assistant Cloud account subscription will end.
     - The end date depends on your subscription type (monthly or yearly).
     - After this period, you will loose access to the following functionality:
       - Secure remote access to your Home Assistant
       - Easy integration with popular voice assistants
       - Cloud storage of your latest backup
2. If you are using the Home Assistant Cloud skills from Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, disconnect them.
3. To delete your Nabu Casa account, select **Manage account**.
   - In the **Danger**  section, select **Delete account**.
   - **Result**: If you deleted your account while there was still time left on your subscription, your account is not deleted immediately. Instead, it will be scheduled for deletion once your subscription expires.
