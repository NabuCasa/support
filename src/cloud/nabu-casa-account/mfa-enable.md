## About multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication uses a combination of two or three different ways to authenticate your identity:

1. Something you know (like a password)
2. Something you have (like a code generated by a device or service only you have access to)
3. Who you are (indicated by some biometric such as a fingerprint)

If you enable multi-factor authentication for Home Assistant Cloud, in addition to your password, you will be asked for a code from a multi-factor authentication application such as Google Authenticator.

## Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Home Assistant Cloud

Step-by-step instructions on enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to your Home Assistant Cloud account.

### Prerequisites

- A [Home Assistant Cloud account](/hc/en-us/articles/25649130769949-Enabling-Home-Assistant-Cloud)
- Home Assistant version 2025.1.0 or later
  - If you're unsure what version you're running, in Home Assistant, open [**Settings** > **About**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/info/).
  - If you are running an older version, and have MFA enabled on Home Assistant Cloud, you won't be able to log into Cloud from Home Assistant. You will need to update Home Assistant first.
- Administrator rights in Home Assistant
- A multi-factor authentication application. For example:
  - A dedicated authenticator app on your phone, such as
    - [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=0)
    - [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)
  - A password manager with authenticator capabilities, such as
    - [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/)
    - If you are using a password manager for this, make sure you have added an entry for your Home Assistant Cloud account.
    - Then, add a section in that entry for one-time password (OTP)

### To enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Home Assistant Cloud

1. On the [Nabu Casa account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/), log into your account.
2. Under **Manage account** > **Multi-factor authentication**, select **Enable MFA**.
   - **Result**: A QR code and a setup code are displayed.
3. To add Home Assistant Cloud to your authenticator app, follow the instructions on screen:
   1. Open your authenticator app.
   2. In the app, either scan the QR code or copy and paste the code manually into the authenticator app.
      - If you are not using a dedicated authenticator app but a password manager, in the entry for the Home Assistant Cloud login, enter a section for one-time password and enter the code there.
      - **Result**: The app generates a one-time code.
4. On the Nabu Casa website, enter the code.
   - **Result**: Multi-factor authentication is enabled.
   - From now on, you need the authenticator app to generate a code every time you log into Home Assistant Cloud.
