{% callout "important" %}

The feature to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Home Assistant Cloud is currently not available. If you already have {% abbr "MFA" %} working, {% abbr "MFA" %} will continue to work. But once you disable {% abbr "MFA" %}, you won't be able to enable it again right now.

## About multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication uses a combination of two or three different ways to authenticate your identity:

1. Something you know (like a password)
2. Something you have (like a code generated by a device or service only you have access to)
3. Who you are (indicated by some biometric such as a fingerprint)

If you enable multi-factor authentication for Home Assistant Cloud, in addition to your password, you will be asked for a code from a multi-factor authentication application such as Google Authenticator.
