We strictly operate as a business-to-consumer provider. As such, we cannot include your VAT number on the invoice.

If you're located in the EU, UK, US, or Canada and see VAT/sales tax charged, this is standard consumer tax. As a B2C provider, we're VAT registered where required by law, but this does not allow business customers to reclaim or reverse-charge VAT.

You can update your billing name and address at https://account.nabucasa.com/:

  1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
  2. Select **Manage Account**.
  3. Update your billing details.

Changes apply to future invoices only. We cannot reissue or modify past invoices due to billing system constraints.

## Business expense reporting

Home Assistant Cloud is sold as a consumer service. Even with updated billing information, invoices remain business-to-consumer transactions and do not support VAT reclaim or business tax treatment. If you need business-grade invoicing, please consult your accounting department about expense policies for consumer services.
