We strictly operate as a business-to-consumer provider. As such, we cannot include your VAT number on the invoice.

If you're located in the EU, UK, US, or Canada and see VAT/sales tax charged, this is standard consumer tax. As a B2C provider, we're VAT registered where required by law, but this does not allow business customers to reclaim or reverse-charge VAT.

You can update your billing name and address at https://account.nabucasa.com/:

  1. Scroll to the bottom of the page
  2. Click "Manage Account"
  3. Update your billing details

Changes apply to future invoices only. We cannot reissue or modify past invoices due to billing system constraints.

## Business expense reporting

Home Assistant Cloud is sold as a consumer service. Even with updated billing information, invoices remain business-to-consumer transactions and do not support VAT reclaim or business tax treatment. If you need business-grade invoicing, please consult your accounting department about expense policies for consumer services.
