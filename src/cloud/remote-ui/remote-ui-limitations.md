The IP address of the incoming request is not being forwarded. This means that you cannot use remote access if you are using one of the following network scenarios:

- If your Home Assistant instance [has configured](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/) `127.0.0.1` or `::1` as trusted networks or proxies.
- If you use IP bans, the remote connection will be banned as a whole instead of just the address from which the incorrect passwords were entered.
  - We are currently exploring a solution for this issue.
