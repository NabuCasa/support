Before you can use the [features provided by Home Assistant Cloud](/hc/en-us/articles/26260474250269/), you have to enable Home Assistant Cloud in Home Assistant.

## To enable Home Assistant Cloud

1. In Home Assistant, go to [**Settings** > **Home Assistant Cloud**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/).

   - **Troubleshooting**: If you do not see **Home Assistant Cloud** under **Settings**, you might have removed the [`default_config`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) integration from your `configuration.yaml`.
     Add `cloud:` to the `configuration.yaml` file.

   ```yml
   # configuration.yaml entry to enable the cloud integration
   cloud:
   ```

2. If you already have an account, sign in.
   - The account name is case-sensitive.
3. If you do not have an account yet, start a trial:
   - Select **Start your free 1 month trial**.
   - To create an account, enter **Email address** and **Password**.
   - Select **Start trial**.
4. Under [**Settings** > **Home Assistant Cloud**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/), you should now see that you are connected to Home Assistant Cloud.
