If you no longer want to upload your backups to Home Assistant Cloud, you can disable Cloud as a backup location.

1. In Home Assistant, go to the [**Settings** > **System** > **Backups** > **Backup settings**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/backup_config/).
2. Under **Locations**, turn off Home Assistant Cloud.
   - **Result**: Your next backup will not be uploaded to Home Assistant Cloud. Your last backup will remain available, unless you [delete it](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#deleting-obsolete-backups).
