## How much does Home Assistant Cloud cost?

After the initial 31-day trial period for new users, the subscription costs $6.50 + tax per month or $65 + tax for the annual plan. The annual plan is available for all countries. The price depends on your location/currency and whether you subscribe to an annual or monthly plan.

## Which payment methods are accepted?

As of August 2022, we support two payment options: Stripe (Credit Cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay) and PayPal.

## Do you offer a lifetime plan or a one time fee?

No. Projecting the lifetime cost of administering a cloud service and adding/maintaining functionality seems a bit unreasonable.

## What happens if I don't enter a payment method?

You will lose access if you did not enter a payment method by the time that your trial expires.

## I moved, how do I update my billing address?

You can update the address used on invoices by going yo the [account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/). There is a "Update billing information" section you can adjust this on.

## I want my VAT number to be attached on the invoice

We strictly operate as a business-to-consumer provider, as such we can not attach your VAT number to the invoice.

## Why has my subscription been cancelled?

This happens after a number of payment attempts have failed. PayPal will then mark a subscription agreement as suspended and creating a new subscription agreement is the only way forward as we cannot remove the suspended status. To find out why a payment is failing it is best to check with the bank which has issued the card. Often a credit card issuer may not support currency conversion, in which case PayPal's conversion option needs to be used.
