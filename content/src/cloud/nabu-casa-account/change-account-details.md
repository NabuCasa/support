## How can I remove my account?

You can delete your account on our [account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/).

If you are currently subscribed to Home Assistant Cloud, you will need to cancel your plan before you can remove your account. You can do this on the [account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/) too. Removing your account while there is still time left on your subscription will not delete your account immediately. Instead it will be scheduled to be deleted once your subscription expires.

## How can I change my payment method?

You can delete your payment method on our [account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/). Your payment method will be used from following monthly payments onward.

## How can I change the email address for my account?

You can change your email address on our [account page](https://account.nabucasa.com/).

## How can I transfer the Nabu Casa subscription to another person?

There is not a way to transfer the subscription from one account to another. Please contact our support if you need help canceling a subscription.
