## Why store a backup in Home Assistant Cloud?

You can use Home Assistant Cloud as part of your [3-2-1 backup strategy](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/01/03/3-2-1-backup/) to minimize your smart home downtime.

### Cloud as your off-site backup location

Storing your latest [Home Assistant backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#backups) on Cloud allows you to recover your system from hardware failures, data corruption, and unexpected disasters affecting your local system. As it is stored outside your system, and off-site, this Home Assistant backup will still be available even if your local Home Assistant system is affected.

### Encrypted and private

Home Assistant Cloud is the privacy-focused cloud. Nabu Casa uses Cloudflare as its storage provider to store backups on Home Assistant Cloud. It specifically uses Cloudflare’s West Europe servers due to high privacy standards compared to other regions.

To maintain the security and privacy of your smart home, backups stored on Home Assistant Cloud are always encrypted using [AES-128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard). Encryption is a method of converting data into a coded format so that it can only be read by someone who has the encryption key. This ensures that your data about your home remains private. So even if someone else had a copy of your Home Assistant backup, it is unreadable for them without the encryption key.

Nabu Casa does not have access to the [encryption key](https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/backup-emergency-kit/).

**_Note_**: Neither your Home Assistant account password nor your Nabu Casa Account password acts as your encryption key. It is a distinct password that must be stored somewhere safe alongside those passwords.
