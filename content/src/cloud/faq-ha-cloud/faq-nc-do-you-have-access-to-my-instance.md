No, we don't. We will only exchange messages between your Home Assistant instance and the Google and Amazon voice assistants. The source code that handles incoming message from the cloud is in this Nabu Casa [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NabuCasa/hass-nabucasa/blob/master/hass_nabucasa/iot.py).
