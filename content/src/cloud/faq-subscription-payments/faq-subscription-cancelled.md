This happens after a number of payment attempts have failed. PayPal will then mark a subscription agreement as suspended and creating a new subscription agreement is the only way forward as we cannot remove the suspended status.

To find out why a payment is failing, check with the bank which has issued the card. Often, a credit card issuer may not support currency conversion. In this case, PayPal's conversion option needs to be used.
