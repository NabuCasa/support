## I want my VAT number to be attached on the invoice

We strictly operate as a business-to-consumer provider, as such we can not attach your VAT number to the invoice.

## Why has my subscription been cancelled?

This happens after a number of payment attempts have failed. PayPal will then mark a subscription agreement as suspended and creating a new subscription agreement is the only way forward as we cannot remove the suspended status. To find out why a payment is failing it is best to check with the bank which has issued the card. Often a credit card issuer may not support currency conversion, in which case PayPal's conversion option needs to be used.
