The [Alexa integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa/) allows you to control the Home Assistant entities via the [Home Assistant Smart Home skill](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa.smart_home/) for Amazon Alexa. You can then say things like "Alexa, turn on the kitchen light" to control your local Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- To use this integration, you need to have an Amazon Alexa enabled device like the Amazon Echo.

- **Note**: The procedure below applies to Home Assistant version 2023.5 and later.
  - If you are running an older version, Amazon Alexa is located under [**Home Assistant Cloud**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/).

## To control Home Assistant entities from Alexa

1. [Set up Home Assistant Cloud](/hc/en-us/articles/25649130769949).
2. Under [**Settings** > **Voice assistant**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/voice_assistants/), enable **Alexa**.

## Manual configuration

You can use the [`configuration.yaml`](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) file to configure the entities that are being shown to Alexa and how they are exposed.

If you use any filters, as shown in the example below, the entities can no longer be exposed via User Interface. They are still listed under [**Settings** > **Voice assistant**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/voice_assistants/) > **Expose**, but are shown grayed out.
