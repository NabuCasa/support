If your backup is smaller than 5GB in size, you have the option to store an encrypted backup on Home Assistant Cloud.

## Prerequisites

A backup will only be uploaded to Home Assistant Cloud if the following requirements are met:

- You are running Home Assistant 2025.1 or later
- Automatic backups have been enabled
- The backup is under 5GB in size

## To setup a Home Assistant Cloud backup

**_Note_**: Home Assistant Cloud will only store one backup at a time on Home Assistant Cloud. It will always store your most recently made encrypted backup.

2. In the step on defining the backup location, enable **Home Assistant Cloud**.
   - **Troubleshooting**: If you do not see **Home Assistant Cloud** as an option in the list, you do not have [Home Assistant Cloud enabled](/hc/en-us/articles/25649130769949).
