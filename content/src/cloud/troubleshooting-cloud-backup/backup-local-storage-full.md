## Symptom

You have [Home Assistant Cloud backup enabled](/hc/en-us/articles/26294320337181-Enabling-a-cloud-backup) in Home Assistant. You see a message stating that the **Local storage is full**.

## Resolution

If your local storage is full, or even nearing full, it may not be possible to generate the backup to upload online. Check if you have enough space in the [storage settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/storage/) to generate your backup.
