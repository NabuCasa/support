If you can't find your encryption key, but you still have access to Home Assistant, follow these steps to [retrieve the encryption key](https://www.home-assistant.io/more-info/backup-emergency-kit/#i-lost-my-backup-encryption-key---how-can-i-retrieve-it) for your Home Assistant Cloud backup.

**Lost encryption key** - If you do not have the key, and you do not have access to Home Assistant, you will not be able to use your backups to restore your system. Nabu Casa does not store your encryption key and cannot provide support in decrypting backups if the key goes missing.
