All M.2 SATA SSDs are **NOT supported**. Besides the following NVMe SSDs are known to **NOT work**:

- WD_BLACK SN850X (1TB)
- WD_BLACK SN770
- WD_BLACK SN750 SE
- SK Hynix BC711
- Crucial P2 CT250P2SSD8
- Lexar NM620
- Samsung 980 Pro
- Samsung PM9B1 MZAL4256HBJD-00BL2 Rev 0

Usually, if one model doesn't work, other models from the same product family have a high chance to be affected as well. Other models may work. For example, the WD Blue SN570 reportedly works, Crucial P2 CT500P2SSD8 (512GB), and Crucial P5 CT1000P5SSD8 (1TB) as well.
