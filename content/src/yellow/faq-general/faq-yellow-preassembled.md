No. We previously offered a Home Assistant Yellow Standard model that came pre-assembled with a Raspberry Pi CM4, but this model is no longer manufactured.

It is now recommended that if you want a more plug-and-play experience, you purchase a [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green), as it requires no assembly and matches many of the capabilities of the Yellow, especially if you add a [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1](https://www.home-assistant.io/connectzbt1) to give it Zigbee/Thread capability.
