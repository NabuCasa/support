## To reassemble the enclosure using 3D-printed parts

1. Placing the rubber ring.
   1. Take the flathead screwdriver and remove the rubber ring from the button.
      - The ring is glued to the button so this will be a bit sticky.
   2. Place the rubber ring onto the new button.

   2. Place the button onto the rotary disk.
   3. Take the dial and take note of the square cutout. It must align with the button.
   4. Slide the dial onto the board and press until it clicks into place.
   5. Rotate the dial. If it does rotate easily, make sure it is not tilted.
