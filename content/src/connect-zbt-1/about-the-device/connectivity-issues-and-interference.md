Zigbee devices, including Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1, can't communicate reliably if they are too close to other electronics which cause interference. Especially USB 3.0 devices are known to interfere with the 2.4&nbsp;GHz based protocols such as Zigbee or Thread.

The video below demonstrates this effect: when the stick is moved closely to a source of interference, the light switch and the light cannot communicate.
