## Symptom

I plugged in Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 but the ZHA Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 integration does not show up on the integration page.

## Resolution

You can try the following steps:

1. Wait a bit longer. It can take a while for Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 to show up.
2. Try a different USB port.
3. Refresh your browser page.
4. Make sure the ZHA integration is not hidden. Select **Show ignored integrations**.
