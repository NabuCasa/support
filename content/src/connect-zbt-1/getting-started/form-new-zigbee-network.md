## To form a new Zigbee network

1. Plugging the extension cable into Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1.
   - Plug the Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 into the USB extension cable.
   - Plug the extension cable into your Home Assistant instance.
   - If you are using the standalone [Home Assistant Container](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-container) installation method, make sure Connect ZBT-1 is [mapped to the container](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#exposing-devices).
   - **Important:** USB 3.0 ports and USB 3.0 drives can cause interference with 2.4 GHz protocols, including the ones provided by Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1. It is important to use the USB extension cable and to position the Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 away from possible interference sources.
    This [video](/hc/en-us/articles/26124431414557) shows the effect of interference.
