1. Removing the Raspberry Pi Compute Module.
   - **Info**: The image shows a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. The steps are the same for the Compute Module 5.
   - **Notice**: To avoid damage to the module, ideally, the module should be pulled up vertically. But this is hard to do.
   - Pull up the module from one side, tilting as little as possible. Tilting can damage the connector.
   - **Info**: This requires quite a bit of force. If it does not work, pull harder.
   - **Notice**: Do not use a screwdriver as a lever. It might damage the board.
