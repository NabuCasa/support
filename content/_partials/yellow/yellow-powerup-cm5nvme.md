1. Power up your Home Assistant Yellow

   - Plug in your Ethernet cable and make sure it is locked into place.
   - The other end of the Ethernet cable will need to be connected to your router or switch and connected to the internet.
   - If you are not using PoE, connect the power to the wall and then to the Home&nbsp;Assistant Yellow.
