<!---Steps on reseating the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. The steps are almost the same as the ones fo rinstalling the CM4, except the heat pads don't need to be placed, as they are already there from the previous installation. -->

1. Aligning the CM4.

    1. Place the board in front of you, the connectors facing to the right.
    1. Orient the CM4: The CE mark needs to be on the bottom.
    1. Use the outline of the chips to help find the correct orientation of the CM4.
        - **Note**: On CM4 Lite variants, the chips on the bottom edge are in a different location.
    1. Carefully place the CM4 without force.
       - The CM4 should fall into place slightly when correctly aligned.

1. Installing the CM4.

    - Press the CM4 board onto the board-to-board connectors until it clicks into place.

      1. Make sure you press on both sides (the two long edges).
          - This requires quite a bit of force.
          - If you don't hear a loud click, it is most likely not fully seated.
      1. Do a visual check to make sure the CM4 is installed correctly.
          - It needs to run parallel to the Home Assistant Yellow board.

1. Placing the heat sink.

    1. Push the 2 plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the heat sink.
    1. Start by first aligning the right plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the carrier board.
    1. Then, place the heat sink onto the CM4.

1. Securing the heat sink.

    - Take the entire board off your workplace and push the pins firmly through the carrier board.
    - Ensure that the CM4 is still fully seated after securing the heat sink.
