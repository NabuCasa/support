## Opening the case

1. Protecting from ESD.

   - Grounding protects the components from the static electricity that can be naturally present (electrostatic discharge, ESD).

   - **Notice**: Risk of damage to the equipment due to electrostatic discharge.
     - Always: Touch the working surface before touching electronics.
     - Ideally: Use ESD protective equipment, such as ESD table mats and grounding cords.

2. Removing the case - bottom part:

   - Remove the 4 screws on the bottom of the Home Assistant Yellow Kit.
   - Keep the thumb screws close by; you will need them again later.
