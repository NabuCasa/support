Perform this procedure if you have Home Assistant 13.1 or later and you want to do a factory reset. If you have a new device, you likely have an older version of Home Assistant Operating System (older than 13.1). In this case, [Reset the device using an SD card](/guides/reset_with_sd_card/)

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant Green
- Home Assistant Operating System 13.1 or later installed.
   - To see which version you have, go to [**Settings** > **About**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/info/).
- PC with internet access
- You have [created a backup](/hc/en-us/articles/25154828325917-Creating-a-backup) and stored it on another system.

> **Note**
> This process clears the data disk on your Green. Unless you [create a backup](/guides/create-backup/), you will lose all data and configuration settings.
> A device reset wipes the data partition of your device. It removes all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and any installed add-ons. The Home Assistant operating system stays on the system.
> Once a device wipe is initiated, the data partition is marked as to be cleared on boot. Then, the system reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.


1. Shut down the system

   1. In your Home Assistant UI, go to **Settings** > **System** and in the top right, select the three-dots menu. Select **Restart Home Assistant**.
   2. Then, select **Shut down system**.
   3. Wait until all the LEDs turned off.
   4. In case the shutdown via UI should not work:
      - To shutdown gracefully, press the power button for 6 seconds.
      - For a hard shutdown (do this only if all else fails), press the power button for 12 seconds.
   5. Remove the power cable to remove power from the system.

2. Power up the system
   1. Press and hold the button.
   2. Reapply power and make sure the system has an Internet connection.
   3. Keep the button pressed until the yellow LED turns on solid.
      - **Troubleshooting**: The yellow LED blinks, instead of turning on solid. This means you do not have the HAOS version required to perform this procedure. In this case, [Reset the device using an SD card](/guides/reset_with_sd_card/)
   4. Release the button.
      - The LEDs start blinking.
      - The Home Assistant operating system now downloads the latest version of Home Assistant Supervisor and Home Assistant Core.
      - Due to the downloads, it can take a while until Home Assistant becomes accessible again.
