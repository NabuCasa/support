- Grounding protects the components from the static electricity that can be naturally present (electrostatic discharge, ESD).

- **Notice**: Risk of damage to the equipment due to electrostatic discharge.
   - Always: Touch the working surface before touching electronics.
   - Ideally: Use ESD protective equipment, such as ESD table mats and grounding cords.
