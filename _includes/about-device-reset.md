<!--- Note about the device reset. Applies to both Home Assistant Green and Yellow. -->

> **Note**
> This process clears the data disk on your device. Unless you create a backup, you will lose all data and configuration settings.
> A device reset wipes the data partition. It removes all user data as well as [Home Assistant Core](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-core), [Supervisor](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-supervisor), and any installed add-ons. The [Home Assistant Operating System](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-operating-system) stays on the system.
> Once a device wipe is initiated, the data partition is marked as to be cleared on boot. Then, the system reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.
