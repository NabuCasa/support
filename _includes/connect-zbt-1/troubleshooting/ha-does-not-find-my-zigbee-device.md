## Symptom

I'm trying to add a Zigbee device using the **Zigbee Home Automation** integration, but Home Assistant doesn't find it.

## Resolution

1. Check the connectivity issues and interference page to troubleshoot interference-related issues.
2. Make sure the device is in pairing mode. To find out how to get your device into pairing mode, check the device documentation. For some devices, pairing mode instructions are also documented on [zigbee.blakadder.com](https://zigbee.blakadder.com).
3. Check the [best practices to avoid pairing issues with Zigbee devices](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/#best-practices-to-avoid-pairingconnection-difficulties).
