## Symptom

I plugged in {{ productName }} but the {{ productName }} integration does not show up on the integration page. It is not in the **Discovered** section.

## Resolution

You can try the following steps:

1. Try a different USB port.
2. Refresh your browser page.
3. Restart Home Assistant to resolve missing USB discoveries.
4. Make sure the {{ productNameShort }} integration is not hidden. Select **Show ignored integrations**.
