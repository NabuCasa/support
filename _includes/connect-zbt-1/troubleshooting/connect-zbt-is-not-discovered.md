## Symptom

I plugged in {{ productName }} but the {{ productNameShort }} integration does not show up on the integration page. It is not under **Discovered**.

## Resolution

You can try the following steps:

1. Wait a bit longer. It can take a while for Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 to show up.
2. Try a different USB port.
3. Refresh your browser page.
4. Make sure the {{ productNameShort }} integration is not hidden. Select **Show ignored integrations**.

5. Restart Home Assistant.
