## Symptom

I plugged in {{ productName }} but the {{ productName }} integration does not show up on the integration page. It is not in the **Discovered** section.

## Resolution

You can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that the USB Discovery is configured. See [USB Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/usb/)
2. Try a different USB cable.
3. Try a different USB port.
4. Refresh your browser page.
5. Restart Home Assistant to resolve missing USB discoveries.
6. Make sure the {{ productName }} integration is not hidden. Select **Show ignored integrations**.
