**Not possible to migrate all settings and devices**

This procedure only helps migrate basic network settings to Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1.

- Customizations like device names will be lost and automations will need to be updated.
- Most powered devices like light bulbs will be re-discovered over time (you can speed this up by rebooting the device) but your battery-powered devices may need to be re-joined to the network for the migration to complete.
- There is currently no migration path to migrate all settings and devices.
