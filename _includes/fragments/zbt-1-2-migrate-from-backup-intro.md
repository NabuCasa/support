Follow these instructions if you are in the following situation:

- You have a Zigbee2MQTT network running, you no longer have the original adapter, and you want to migrate to {{ productName }}.

Please note that not all settings can be migrated in this case:

- These steps help migrate the network, meaning you won't have to pair all your devices again with {{ productName }}.
- However, some higher-level settings cannot be migrated. Elements such as device names may be lost. There is currently no migration path to transfer all settings.
