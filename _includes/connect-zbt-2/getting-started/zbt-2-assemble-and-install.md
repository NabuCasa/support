  - **Notice**: Be careful not to overtighten. It could damage the device beyond repair.
- Don't fix the device into place permanently yet.
  - After you have connected the device to Home Assistant, check if your device is in a good spot or if there is interference. If the device seems unresponsive, you might want to move it to another location.
